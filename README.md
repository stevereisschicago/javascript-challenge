# javascript-challenge

This is the javascript homework.

I've completed both sections (UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2), I have not broken them out and am using the UFO-level-1 folder for both as the app.js and index.html files are short and there wasn't a lot of code to add between level-1 and level-2

Screenshots of both the initial / index webpage and a search results webpage are included in the images file.
