# javascript-challenge

This is the javascript homework.

I've completed both sections (UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2), I have not broken them out and am using the UFO-level-1 folder as the app.js and indext.html files are both short and there wasn't a lot of code to add between level-1 and level-2

Screenshots of both the initial page and a search results page are included in the images file.
